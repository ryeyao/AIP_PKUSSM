Assignment 1

Two tasks:

1. Writing a program in C/C++ to calculate words' occurancy. Note that 'examples' and 'example' should be treated as different word.

<<<<<<< HEAD
2. Writing a program performing the communication via signal between the father process and the child process.


Notes:

There are two versions of task #1. The one with a _regex appended is implemented with boost library supported. The other one is implemented with switch-case.

Q&A:
Q: How to fix the 'undefined reference to detail_regex...' or the similar error while compiling the code?
A: You should have 'boost' libiraries installed in your environment. 
  a. To archieve this you can simply type the following command in the terminal(I assume that you are using Debian Linux like ubuntu):
  
     $ sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev

  b. Modify the Makefile in the 'LIBS' variant's value, change the old boost lib path to your own.
